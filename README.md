This repository contains my Kaggle projects. 

### P1 - [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- Built a categorical model to predict survival rates using EDA, feature engineering and ensemble techniques.

### P2 - [House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
- Built a regression model to predict house prices using EDA, feature engineering and ensemble techniques. 

### P3 - [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)
- Built a CNN model using Tensorflow to identify digits from handwritten images.

### P4 - [ALASKA2 Image Steganalysis](https://www.kaggle.com/c/alaska2-image-steganalysis)
- Added pseudo-labeling technique to a pretrained model using Pytorch to detect secret data hidden within digital images.

### P5 - [SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification)
- Trained a model with ensemble techniques using TensorFlow on Kaggle to identify melanoma in lesion images.
