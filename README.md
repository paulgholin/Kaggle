This repository contains my Kaggle projects. 

### P1 - Titanic
- Built a categorical model to predict survival rates using EDA, feature engineering and ensemble techniques.

### P2 - House Prices
- Built a regression model to predict house prices using EDA, feature engineering and ensemble techniques. 

### P3 - Digit Recognizer
- Built a CNN model using Tensorflow to identify digits from handwritten images.

### P4 - ALASKA2 Image Steganalysis
- Added pseudo-labeling technique to a pretrained model using Pytorch to detect secret data hidden within digital images.
